# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
This project accurately classify brain tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary.  By leveraging a CNN I was able to design a robust and scalable solution for medical image classification. The model  demonstrated significant potential in aiding early diagnosis and providing  support to medical practitioners.
